# Tkinter GUI Programming by Example
This is the code repository for [Tkinter GUI Programming by Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/tkinter-gui-programming-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788627481), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will get you up and running with Tkinter by creating some fun and interactive projects. These projects have a varying degree of complexity. We’ll start with a simple project where you'll learn the fundamentals of GUI programming and the basics of working with a Tkinter application. After getting the basics right, we'll move on to creating a project of slightly-increased complexity, such as a highly-customizable Python editor, where you'll learn about Tkinter widgets, event handlers, and more.

With the next project, we'll crank up the complexity level to create an instant messaging app, where you’ll learn about network, multithreading, and database programming. The aim is to strengthen your foundation with the Tkinter framework. Towards the end, we’ll discuss various ways of packaging our applications so that they can be shared and installed on other machines without the user needing to learn how to install and run Python programs.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Assets folder is used in Chapter 2, 3, 4.  Images for Blackjack game needs to be downloaded. the link is provided in the book.

The code will look like the following:
```
self.label_text = tk.StringVar()
self.label_text.set("Choose One")
```

[*] A basic understanding of the Python language and its syntax, including functions, if statements, while and for loops, and file handling
[*] A computer (desktop or laptop) running Windows, Linux, or macOS, which has Python version 3.6 (or higher) installed
[*] Pip and Virtualenv installed along with Python
[*] An internet connection to download any external dependencies, which will be needed for our projects
